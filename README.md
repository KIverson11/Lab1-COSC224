# Lab1-COSC224
Lab 1

Chose option 2: Create a web page with header, footer, sidebar, etc...

Kody did the nav bar, the content and the css. 3 branches
Jordan did the footer and css. 2 brances
and both did a bunch of pull requests. 

*Note: Some branches were added back after being deleted. These branches appear to have no pull requests or code, they are just on the github as documentation that they existed.
